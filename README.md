Caesar Cipher
Decrypted text: “Hvs Eiwqy Pfckb Tcl Xiadg Cjsf Hvs Zonm Rcu.”
Result: “The quick brown fox will jump over the lazy dog.”

Discussion: 
The Caesar cipher is not secure because it is very easy to break. There are only 25 possible shifts, so someone can try all of them very quickly (brute-force). Also, it does not hide letter patterns, so frequency analysis can reveal the message. Some old systems or legacy devices might still use similar simple encryption for basic data protection or obfuscation, but it is not safe for modern security needs.
